# Databases

A **database** is a structured collection of data organized in a way that it can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. Databases are used to store and retrieve information for various purposes such as managing business operations, storing user information in web applications, and more.

### Relational Models:

The **relational model** is a way of organizing data in tables (relations) with rows (tuples) and columns (attributes). It was introduced by Edgar Codd in the early 1970s. In a relational database, data is organized into one or more tables, and relationships between the tables are established using keys.
