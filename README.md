# Databases

A **database** is a structured collection of data organized in a way that it can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. Databases are used to store and retrieve information for various purposes such as managing business operations, storing user information in web applications, and more.

### Relational Models:

The **relational model** is a way of organizing data in tables (relations) with rows (tuples) and columns (attributes). It was introduced by Edgar Codd in the early 1970s. In a relational database, data is organized into one or more tables, and relationships between the tables are established using keys.

### Tables, Rows, and Columns:

- **Table**: A table is a collection of related data organized in rows and columns. Each table in a database has a unique name.

- **Row (Tuple)**: A row represents a single record or entry in a table. It contains a set of values corresponding to the attributes (columns) defined for that table.

- **Column (Attribute)**: A column represents a specific type of data in a table. It defines the kind of information that will be stored in that column.

### Keys:

- **Primary Key**: A primary key is a unique identifier for each record in a table. It ensures that each row can be uniquely identified. Primary keys are used to enforce entity integrity.

- **Foreign Key**: A foreign key is a field in a table that refers to the primary key in another table. It establishes relationships between tables.
